# ORM Challenge: E-commerce Back End

  ## Description

  This challenge required me to build the back-end for an e-commerce site which I was provided starter code for. In order to get everything running properly, I had to take a working express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Usage

  1. Start up MySQL in the terminal and run the schema file.
  2. Enter seed commands for the development database to be created and be seeded with test data.
  3. Start the server by entering 'node server.js' in the terminal
  4. Open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for either 'categories', 'products' or 'tags'.
  5. Test the POST, PUT and DELETE routes.

  ## Technologies

  1. Express.js
  2. MySQL, Sequelize
  3. Insomnia Core
